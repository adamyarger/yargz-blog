## History of Money

Since the launch of the Bitcoin network in 2009, blockchain technology has created an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars and launched a wave of innovation in distributed systems, cryptography, and economics. Some believe that blockchains will be integral to the future of money, governments, and the Internet. Others claim that this is a transient bubble, and cryptocurrencies will be relegated to a footnote in history.‌

If you alreayd have prior web development experience you could probably dive straight into developing dapps in ethereum, but sooner or later you'll hit a wall. If your serious about learning blockchain and how to create software that lives on the blockchain you have to come from first principles. Thats why were starting with a history lesson of the different technologies and ideas that slowly collided together to mine that first gensis block of bitcoin in *03/Jan/200*.

What different disciplines combined to make bitcoin possible.
- history of money
  - Why was bitcoin created?
  - Why did it take off when it did?
  - Why did it work when other failed?
  - Read this article about the history of money and how i ultimately lead to bitcoin.

## The Cypherpunks

- Why read this? This is where the original idea of crating money that lived on the internet was orignally conceived.
- In 1992, three Bay Area computer scientists launched a new mailing list for discussing cryptography, mathematics, politics, and philosophy. They called the members of this mailing list the cypherpunks: a portmanteau of cyberpunk, a genre of dystopian sci-fi, and ciphers, a staple of cryptography.
- The cypherpunks were an eclectic crew, but they all shared a core conviction: that the Internet would soon become an important battleground for human freedom.
- why were the cypherpunks important?
  - the moviment sparked many of the ideas that made bitcoin possible, chaum created digicash, from its failure they saw that centralization woulnt work, money need to be controlled by no one so it could stand the test of time.
  - hashcash for email spam prevention, the idea of gas in ethereum is similar
  - what did mojo nation do? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnet_%28peer-to-peer_network%29#MojoNation
- We know that Satoshi was aware of b-money and he cited it in his whitepaper, and he later added an acknowledgement to BitGold on the Bitcoin website.
- It was ultimately the cypherpunks who laid the groundwork for the creation of something like Bitcoin.

## Satoshi Nakamoto

From this we can conclude that Satoshi was well aware of his predecessors—of the cypherpunks and of academic innovations in cryptography. Satoshi did not create Bitcoin from scratch, but instead remixed many ideas that had never before been combined.

## Big Idea
- What are the building blocks of bicoin?
  - Ralph Merkle's work on Merkle trees
  - Haber and Stornetta's work on cryptographic timestamping services
  - Hashcash by Adam Back
  - b-money by Wei Dai (this reference was added to a later version of the white paper, on the encouragement of Adam Back)
  - His principal innovation was in using proof-of-work to create a new consensus protocol, which sits at the core of all proof-of-work blockchains
  - Satoshi acknowledged Bitcoin as a descendant of the P2P file sharing networks
- Whats the history of each building block?
