If you want to learn to code you have to start young. If you're not writing your first compiler by age 5, you should really just give up. You have no chance. How are you ever going to compete with those kids at Stanford?

In reality, the internet is the great equalizer. It’s reinventing industries, tearing down walls and giving people a voice. The people who make that possible write code. Sure there's some really smart people who have fancy degrees from fancy universities. But it’s not required. All you need is a laptop and an internet connection.

All the resources you need to completely change your life are free online. You just need a little drive and for someone to point you in the right direction.

Never before has there been a skill that can pull people into the middle class or even make them into billionaires.

Broadcast television used to own the information. You wanted to say something to a lot of people. Too bad. Now you can get your message across to millions of people with the click of a button. It's built on code. See, code is freedom. It's art. It's creativity. The best part about it is you don't need a degree.

Even feckless plebs like me, who were just wandering idiots spending truck loads of money on useless degrees can code.

The trick is to try things, even if they're really hard at first, just keep going. In his book “The First 20 Hours”, Josh Kaufman calls this the frustration barrier. He explains:

“Many things aren’t fun until you’re good at them. Every skill has what I call a frustration barrier—a period of time in which you’re horribly unskilled, and you’re painfully aware of that fact.”

Once you break past it you can get a more accurate gage of if you like it. When you find that hard thing that you enjoy doing in your free time, you've struck gold. You’ll have a leg up on everyone else since what they consider to be work you consider to be fun.

Don’t worry if the things you’re building are useless in the eyes of others, not everything has to be a business. Like I said, code is art.

Artists don’t have to tell people why they made something, they just do it because they wanted to. Why should coding be any different? I think a good example of this is 98.css, this has little to no utility other than being cool and nostalgic, guess what, 6000 other people agree.

Once you do this for long enough your skills will start to compound, things others thought were useless were really building your experience. When your side projects bring you joy you can hack on them all night long, those extra hours add up.

All that matters is you just start coding.
