If you want to learn to code you have to start young. If you're not writing your first compiler by age 5, you should really just give up. You have no chance. How are you ever going to compete with those kids at Stanford?

In reality, the internet is the great equalizer. It’s reinventing industries, tearing down walls and giving people a voice. The people who make that possible write code. Sure there's some really smart people who have fancy degrees from fancy universities. But it’s not required. All you need is a laptop and an internet connection.

All the resources you need to completely change your life are free online. You just need a little drive and for someone to point you in the right direction.

Never before has there been a skill that can pull people into the middle class or even make them into billionaires with a team of 13 people (insert whatsapp).

Broadcast television used to own the information. You wanted to say something to a lot of people. Too bad. Now you can get your message across to millions of people with the click of a button. It's built on code. See, code is freedom. It's art. It's creativity. The best part about it is you don't need a degree.

Even feckless plebs like me, who were just wandering idiots spending truck loads of money on useless degrees can code.
